<h1>Privacy Policy (v. 2)</h1>

<h2>How user data will be treated</h2>

<p>We value your privacy. Because of that, Babykarte doesn't collect any user data. No cookies are being saved and no usage statistics are being generated.</p>

<p>The Babykarte isn't a map provider or a database but a portal. All user input will be transmitted to third parties who provide the data needed to show the desired information. This causes that third parties receive some personal information about the users of Babykarte.</p>

<p>The following list reveals which third parties are in use, what they are used for and where you can find their privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Third Parties we use</h2>

<p>This website is located on GitHub Servers so that Babykarte can be reached with a Browser. Because of that GitHub receives some data about our users e.g. IP address, operating system and which browser is in use (see below). How GitHub threats collected data can be looked up in their <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Komoot is used as the search engine. When you use the search field to search for a place, after the third character Babykarte will send the query and your system language to Komoot. How Komoot treats the data it gets from Babykarte can be read in their <a href="https://www.komoot.de/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>When you visit the Babykarte, your browser requests some data from cache servers to reduce loading time. These servers are cache servers powered by two companies. The first one is Google and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#infocollect">here</a> you can find their privacy policy. The second one is DigitalOcean and has also its own <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>. Babykarte cannot control which data your browser sends to these servers.</p>

<p>Babykarte uses data from the OpenStreetMap Community for displaying its map and other data like address, opening hours and other location data. The OpenStreetMap Foundation (St John’s Innovation Centre, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WS, United Kingdom) (OSMF) hosts this data on their servers. They receive the following information from the Babykarte: Which filters are selected, user language and the coordinates of the map. Your browser might send additional data to the OpenStreetMap-servers like the browser's name, operating system's name etc. (see below). These servers are located in the UK and other countries. They might also store cookies in your browser that are needed for providing their services. Babykarte has no control over these connections and processing of your data by the OSMF. Find out more in their <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>It's not technically possible for us to provide information about the data collected. We don't collect data by ourselves, and we don't instruct someone else to do it for us. We don't know anything about you. The third parties might collect data about you.</strong></p>

<h2>Responsible entity</h2>

<p>Responsible for data processing on this website:  </p>

<p>Michael Brandtner <br />
Weißenburgstraße 3 <br />
24116 Kiel <br />
Germany  </p>

<p>Phone: +49 431 64367480 <br />
E-mail: brandtner_michael@yahoo.de  </p>

<p>Responsible entity is the natural or legal person who, alone or in concert with others, decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (such as names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>

<h2>Right to appeal at the appropriate supervisory body</h2>

<p>In the case of violations against the GDPR, the persons concerned have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

<h2>Description of user data (Definition)</h2>

<p>Babykarte doesn't collect user data, but it redirects it to third parties.</p>

<p>Below you will find a description of data third parties process and may store.</p>

<ul>
<li>(Public) IP Address
<ul><li>The address of your router. The router gets its address from your internet provider. It's not the individual address of your computer, smartphone etc. The public IP address can be saved by the websites you visit.</li>
<li>Normally your internet provider provides you with a new IP address after 24 hours. Websites who saved your previous IP cannot identify you anymore by just relaying on your IP.</li>
<li>The router between your computer and the internet therefore acts as a firewall.</li></ul></li>
<li>Timestamp
<ul><li>Includes time and date.</li>
<li>Timestamps won't be sent by your browser. The website you visit adds them automatically.</li></ul></li>
<li>Browser
<ul><li>You use your browser to navigate the internet. For example navigating to OpenStreetMap, Komoot, GitHub, Google etc.</li>
<li>Name e.g. Firefox, Chrome or Safari. The version number counts too.</li></ul></li>
<li>Device type
<ul><li>Name of your device you use to navigate the internet.</li>
<li>Examples: Huawei p9 lite, Samsung S3 Mini</li></ul></li>
<li>Operating system's name.
<ul><li>The name of your operating system you use to navigate the internet.</li>
<li>Examples: Windows 10, Linux/Debian</li></ul></li>
<li>The site you came from (Referrer).
<ul><li>Internet address from which the requests to OSM Server, to Komoot etc. are sent to. This will be always the internet address of Babykarte.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Definitions</h2>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are small text files which are saved on your device by your browser by websites order. Read in the user manual of your browser for how you can control this behaviour.</p>

<h3>Cache server</h3>

<p>A cache server saves files, which are often requested by browsers. This reduces load time. Website developers use cache servers as a storage for files which are often required for web programming and therefore also for users.</p>

<h3>Location of the user</h3>

<p>Your browser asks you if Babykarte should be given the permission to access your current location. If you agree, the Babykarte will jump to your geographical position where your browser assumes your location.
The accuracy of the detected location depends on the used location mechanism. If you don't agree, locating won't work.</p>

<p>When your browser doesn't ask you for permission to let Babykarte access your location, then you might have allowed to save your decision permanently.</p>

<p>The Babykarte doesn't request your location in the background, it requests it only once when you click on the desired button.</p>

<h2>Is this data sensible?</h2>

<p>Not really. Most users have enabled their used apps to update automatically or it is a default behaviour.</p>

<ul>
<li>At least the most users use Windows 10 or Windows 7. So the name of the operating system equals to the majority.</li>
<li>At least the most users use Safari, Chrome or Firefox. They also being hold up to date.</li>
<li>Every network has its individual (public) IP address but normally your network gets a new one after 24 hours.</li>
<li>Device type: Nobody uses an individual device type. For example many people have a Huawei p9 lite.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why are they being collected?</h2>

<p>This may have some of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>To detect how many times an operating system is used, which browser is being used.</li>
<li>To solve problems with some browsers and or operating systems.</li>
<li>To have the possibility to trace back your IP address by an authority in cases a user — hopefully not you — attacked the provider.</li>
<li>To find out what the user might like or dislike. Usually big companies do that but they depend on a variety of data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How can I prevent data collection?</h2>

<p>You can't or at least just with opt out functions. But you're in the position of faking data or to hide your identity.</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the TOR Browser.</li>
<li>Modern browsers provide you with a way to have all saved information on your computer deleted after closing it. Refer to your browser's user manual for more information about it and how to activate this function.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Updates of this privacy policy</h2>

<p>A version number on the hyperlink to this privacy policy indicates a change to this policy. You're responsible to look up the changes on your own behalf.</p>
